        <h3>El Capitan, Yosemite National Park, U.S.A. - June 2018</h3>

        <h3>Railay beach, Thaidand - March 2018</h3>
        <p>Railay beach is a paradise for climbers. I stayed there for 2 weeks with my wife and kids. It was my third time to visit Railay.</p>
        <p>It was in 1996 that I visited this place for the fist time. Things changed a lot since then but the quality of the rocks remains great!</p>
